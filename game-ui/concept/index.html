            <h1> Game Concept </h1>
            <p> My game is a simulation donut restaurant game where the user will need to take orders from customers, make the donuts, and deliver orders in a timely manner to keep customers happy and earn tips. User will need to toggle between the stations and manage all parts of the restaurant. Each "day" in the game the user will attempt to earn as much money as they can. Earning more money will allow them to level up so they can buy new outfits, open new menu items, and make upgrades to the restaurant via decorations or hiring other employees to help with the workload. </p>

            <h1>UI Components</h1>
            <p>UI Components for this game might include a countdown clock for making the donuts, a customer's mood status as they wait for an order, an order area that displays each customer's order, the cards that show each customer's specific order, a progress bar showing each stage of the process the user needs to go through to make the order, a timer or progress bar for the donuts that are cooking,the options that the user has for customizing the donuts such as toppings and frosting, an indicator when the order is ready to head out to the customer, and a tip jar that shows the amount of tips received from customers throughout the day. It might also include a 'shop' section where the user can make upgrades to their character and the restaurant by purchasing clothing, decorations, and other improvements.</p>

            <h3>Components I'll Build</h3>
            <p>I plan to build the display of customers' orders; the progress bar that the user toggles between each stage of the process; the countdown clock for making the donuts; the customers' mood bar indicator; and the donut-customization making station.</p>
